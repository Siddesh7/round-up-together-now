# Community Chit Fund App - Hackathon MVP

A modern platform for organizing group-based savings (chit funds), where members contribute monthly and one member receives the pooled amount in turn. Built for hackathon scope with a focus on treasury protection, group dynamics, and user experience.

## üéØ Product Overview

This app implements a **focused, cleaned-up MVP** for community chit funds with three group types:

- **Private Groups** ‚Äî invite-only among trusted people
- **Public Groups** ‚Äî open to anyone with contribution caps
- **Community Groups** ‚Äî for vetted community members (e.g., Discord-verified)

## üè¶ Treasury Model

- **First month contributions** go directly to a **treasury** (protocol reserve) to build confidence and provide initial stability
- From the **second month onward**, participants can begin to claim the pooled pot
- Members who claim later (e.g., 10th month) receive **interest on their pot** ‚Äî fixed at 7% for demonstration

**Example**: If a participant claims the 10th month, they get the pooled pot plus 7% extra.
